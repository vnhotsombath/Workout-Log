# Welcome to **Dang Trains**!

### Often times people find themselves unsure of what they will do for a work-out. Things go unplanned, the exercises are random and there is no structure. My passion of fitness inspired me to create this web-based app to help others be able to keep track/log their work-outs. 

Check out the app [here](https://dangtrains-22.herokuapp.com/)
